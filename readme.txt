Providing full control to set your own responsive image properties for WP 4.4+, the ability to use the &lt;picture&gt; tag and image backgrounds.

== Description ==

The Just Responsive Images plugin gives you control of responsive image properties,
which WordPress 4.4+ inserts to all post thumbnails by default.

The default solution is to insert all available image sizes as srcset attribute into img tag. This is not optimal,
because the browser gets too much image resolutions, it can generate more requests to the server (to get the right image)
and it takes longer to display the image itself. Not to mention, Google Page Speed inspector is not satisfied with
such a method.

If you have hand-coded a mobile-friendly HTML/CSS for your theme it usually has media queries for background images
and &lt;picture&gt; tags instead of &lt;img&gt; tags. A lot of images are used as block backgrounds very often,
which should be editable from CMS. All these best practices are not supported in the WordPress core by default and
you end up wasting your time re-writing standard functions.

That's why we're here! We want to provide easy-to-use control for customizing srcset for each image size dimension you
use inside your theme. Also we're happy to provide you with a few helpers which will generate tags and generate required
media queries for backgrounds.


Full documentation and configuration options are available on our github page:
https://github.com/justcoded/just-responsive-images.

Feel free to post your suggestions or bugs under Issues section on github.

**IMPORTANT**

In version 1.2 default RWD set background options updated to mobile-first strategy (from desktop-first).
If you use nested rules from RWD set you should update your main size background option to have @media query with `min-width` rule.

== Installation ==

1. Download, unzip and upload to your WordPress plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin within you WordPress Administration Backend
3. Add hook `add_filter('rwd_image_sizes', 'my_rwd_image_sizes');`
4. Create new function `my_rwd_image_sizes` and set the configuration array. The example can be found inside the plugin folder in `/data/config-example.php`.

== Upgrade Notice ==

To upgrade remove the old plugin folder. After than follow the installation steps 1-2.
